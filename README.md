# Dummy
Where You can save your Contacts
Abstract-The main aim of this project was to create a web app that would serve the purpose of a Telephone. The app should be running on a Computer or Laptop as well as on a smartphone as well i.e it should be responsive.
The app should have a landing page where a new user will land whenever he visits it for the first time.Further a login/registration page is needed to verify the user.
The app should provide four options:
1)Add a new contact
2)Update an existing contact
3)Delete an existing contact
4)Search for an existing contact



The app should have an user friendly  Interface.Header and footers are expected on web pages to maintain the  flow of the app.
Flow of the Project:



Log in/Sign in:The user will be asked to login/register in order to use the web app.If a new user arrives he will be registering with the app by entering basic info.

Tools and Technology used:
Languages used:HTML5,CSS,, JavaScript,PHP,MYSQL
Framework:BOOTSTRAP
Softwares used:Sublime text,Browser, XAMPP

Our experience with the Project: 
Software designing isn't especially when it has to be developed from scratch. Whenever a project is assigned teamwork is necessary.A single person cannot handle each and every job.Initially time has to invested in thinking about how the given problem statement can be tackled in the most appropriate way. Once we are done with these brainstorming sessions we move towards designing the Front end. An important thing to note is the use of Github so that entire team can simultaneously work on the codes and necessary rectifications can be done.The web pages can be distributed so that workload is reduced and efficiency is achieved.When all the webpages are designed it is time to link all of them.This involves back end coding done in PHP. Database connectivity is also essential because the data coming from front end has to be stored in the back end.The website (in this case) is hosted on a local server. 
	This Entire Experience will certainly add a much needed experience to our profile and help us buildthe professional attitude towards a task.
